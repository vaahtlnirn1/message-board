## Backend (NodeJS with Express) Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory (message-board-server)
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `node server.js`

## Frontend (React) Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory (message-board)
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (you may need to install 'axios' manually; 'npm i' may not do it automatically and you will need 'npm install axios')
3. Start the application: `npm start`

## Notes
- No authentication or user identity management is implemented, as requested.
- Error handling is implemented, but minimal (console logs)
- In-memory database is used to simulate a backend, as suggested and for simplicity as if this were a real prototype.
- The frontend is not extremely well styled, but it is functional.

## TODO (what is missing from this implementation / what could be improved or added / what I would personally add)
- Better styling / colors
- There are no tests written for this project.
- I would have better implemented the 'api.js' file.
- I would have added a 'loading' state to the frontend.
- I would refine the animation and scrolling behaviors to make them more scalable
- Ability to delete or edit messages would be an extra

There are many types of services that this app could eventually be a part of or a starting template for. For example, a chat app, a social media app, a blog, etc. During my implementation, I toed the line enough to follow given directions as instructed and to add my own features to show my attention to detail and my abilities in the field. I wanted to emphasize my potential and abilities while not going overboard and into the direction of not following the given instructions, so I kept deviations to a minimum.
